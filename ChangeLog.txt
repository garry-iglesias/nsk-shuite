Initial ChangeLog message.
This file will be the public brief for the NoStress Kommando Shell Suite.

Those tools were in-house projects. They will be released publicly and
are not yet full-featured, and bug-free. Also documentation is sparse
and should be improved "on demand".

A couple of BASH scripts gathered from NSHQ devs:
   * Kommando Auto-builder: a build integration tool.
   * Kommando Change Logger: a tool to maintain ChangeLogs like this one.
   * Kommando Hack Assist: a command line "power tool" for admin and devops.
   * Kommando Publisher: a git repo selection publisher.
   * A simple ISO mounter.
   * A "quick-and-dirty" installer: a simple tool to generate a ~/bin symlink
     to a specified executable.
   * A git repository tool to easily work with several git repositories.
   * System Configuration Version Control: a tool to keep a track of
     configuration file in a git repository.
   * A init ramdisk file extractor.
   * SSH Key autogen and upload: "brute" script to configure remote SSH key.

This collection of tools have been developed over the initial period of
2013-2016 for internal development and administration.
